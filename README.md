# JavaAOC2020
Every year Eric Wastl publishes an advent calender, with two programming exercises for every day in december
until christmas morning, called Advent of Code (AOC). I chose to do advent of code to show my knowledge in a
given language, and also maintain my skills in that language. The reason why I do not try new languages in
AOC is that I do so in projects at the university. So to maintain my skills in languages I already master,
I use them for the exercises in AOC.
